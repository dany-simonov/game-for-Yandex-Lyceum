This repository contains the source code for a 2D platformer game developed using Pygame. The game engine leverages PyTMX for efficient map loading from TMX files, allowing for complex level designs. Player interaction includes movement, jumping (with double jump capability), and collecting keys. The game features three distinct levels: a dilapidated castle, an underground cavern, and a series of sky islands. Each level presents unique challenges, including platforming puzzles and encounters with enemy characters (birds, bats, and ghosts). A persistent achievement system tracks player progress, storing completed achievements in an SQLite database. The achievement system tracks various milestones, such as completing levels, collecting all keys within a level, and even specific deaths (e.g., dying from enemy contact).

The game includes a main menu providing access to the levels, an achievements screen (with scrolling functionality for a potentially large number of achievements), and a control screen detailing the game’s keyboard controls. Sprite animations are implemented for the player character and enemies to enhance visual appeal.

To run the game, ensure you have Pygame and PyTMX installed (pip install pygame pytmx). You’ll also need an SQLite database setup (this should be handled automatically by the database.py module); you’ll need to have the necessary asset files (“levels” directory containing TMX files, and “assets” directory with spritesheets) in the appropriate locations relative to the main script. Run the game by executing main.py. Future development will focus on adding more levels and features, and refining the user interface.
